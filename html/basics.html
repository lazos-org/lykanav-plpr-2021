					<p>
						The people you know on the Internet are not always who they claim to be. They may lie to you to gain your trust.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Never give out your personal information or disclose to other Internet users information about your friends, family or school.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Do not disclose the passwords you use.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Do not trade online to buy products and do not provide credit card details.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Be wary of accepting what you read on the Internet or what other users tell you before submitting it to your judgment.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Talk to your teachers, your parents and people you trust about your online activities, especially if you encounter anything strange or unusual.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Always keep in mind that the products of intellectual creation (music, literature, cinema, video, etc.) are protected by law and their distribution via the Internet is an illegal act.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The same illegal act is considered the distribution of computer programs (Software), unless they belong to the category of Free Software (Open source software).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Do not open emails and attachments from unknown senders with or without a subject. They are very likely to contain viruses and cause serious problems on your computer.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Do not use indiscriminately any program you find on the Internet. Not all programs are safe, even if they appear as games.
