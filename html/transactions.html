					<p>	Τhe risks of online trading:<br>
						There is a whole range of security threats out there to beware of, including malware, phishing attacks, hacking and spam mail. To defend against these threats, make sure that you update your platform’s operating system regularly, and use a strong SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).

						1. Online Security
						There is a whole range of security threats out there to beware of, including malware, phishing attacks, hacking and spam mail. To defend against these threats, make sure that you update your platform’s operating system regularly, and use a strong SSL (Secure Sockets Layer).
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						2. System Reliability
						The Internet service provider (ISP) server could crash, your online payment system could show errors and the ecommerce plugin could have bugs.
						Except keeping all operating systems and APIs updated, these are just some things that may happen outside of our control.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						3. Privacy Issues
						Customers’ personal data could be compromised and used for spamming, identity theft and unsolicited marketing.
						In addition to the online security measures previously mentioned, make sure to require customers to use strong passwords.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						4. Customer Disputes
						A customer might not have received their order, their credit card was charged twice, or the product their received didn’t fit the online description.
						Whether the customer is right or not, it’s important to always have great customer service and to rectify all possible mistakes that were made.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						5. Credit Card Fraud
						Someone could use a stolen credit card to make an online purchase, or a hacker could use stolen credit data from other customers in your system.
						No matter how good your online security measures are, always watch out for any suspicious transactions.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						6. Intellectual Property Issues
						Your website images, product descriptions, logos, videos, music, as well as your products, could be copied by others, or violate someone else’s intellectual property.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						7. SEO
						Google or other platforms could do a complete makeover of their algorithm at any time, and make your website traffic drop significantly overnight.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						8. Taxation
						You might not be including the appropriate sales tax in your sales, or you are not paying fair shipping and/or import taxes depending on your shipping destination.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						9. Return of Goods and Warranty
						Common headaches when dealing with product returns: Increase in supply chain costs and not being able to resell the items at their original price.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						10. Warehousing and Logistics Issues
						You could run out of stocks while orders are coming in, a product shipment might be delayed, or a parcel could be delivered to the wrong recipient.
						These are risks that come with the territory when running an ecommerce business.
						The most important thing you can do is to always keep these in mind, and to build a strategy on how to deal with them once they happen.

					<p>Safe online transaction<br>
					Online shopping is a modern blessing, but the risk of financial data being stolen can make it feel more like a curse. Avoid that sinking feeling after clicking “Complete Transaction” by taking these steps to make sure your online transaction is secure.</p>

					<p>
						1. Use a Secure Connection
						Make sure that both the Wi-Fi connection and the website URL that you’re using are secure. Never share personal or financial data over a public Wi-Fi connection. If you must shop over public Wi-Fi, use a VPN (virtual private network) to add security to the transaction.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						2. Use a Trusted Website
						Verify the security of the website you’re using by looking for ”https” at the beginning of the URL and checking for the closed lock or unbroken key in the browser, which indicates that your data will be secure and encrypted when submitted on that website.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						3. Read the Privacy Statement
						Any reputable site will clearly disclose how they protect and secure your personal information, including your credit card or banking data. Taking a few minutes to read the full privacy statement is worth it to ensure that you’re comfortable with the company’s privacy practices before you complete an online transaction.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						4. Opt for Credit over Debit
						A credit card offers you far more protection from fraud than a debit card. It’s a warning sign if a site only accepts debit cards or other forms of payment like PayPal. If a shady online peddler gets a hold of your debit card information, they could wipe out your bank account. Always use a credit card for online transactions, especially if it’s a new company or website that you haven’t done business with before.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						5. Keep an Eye on Your Accounts
						Sometimes the most crucial time to verify the security of an online transaction is after the fact. Keep copies of all confirmation and order numbers, and watch your credit card statements closely for any discrepancies. If you spot anything suspicious, alert the credit card company immediately.
